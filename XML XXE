How to Prevent

Developer training is essential to identify and mitigate XXE. Besides that, preventing XXE requires:
* Whenever possible, use less complex data formats such as JSON, and avoiding serialization of sensitive data.
* Patch or upgrade all XML processors and libraries in use by the application or on the underlying operating system. Use dependency checkers. Update SOAP to SOAP 1.2 or higher.
* Disable XML external entity and DTD processing in all XML parsers in the application, as per the OWASP Cheat Sheet ‘XXE Prevention’.
* Implement positive (“whitelisting”) server-side input validation, filtering, or sanitization to prevent hostile data within XML documents, headers, or nodes.
* Verify that XML or XSL file upload functionality validates incoming XML using XSD validation or similar (not DTD).
* SAST tools can help detect XXE in source code, although manual code review is the best alternative in large, complex applications with many integrations.
If these controls are not possible, consider using virtual patching, API security gateways, or Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to detect, monitor, and block XXE attacks.
