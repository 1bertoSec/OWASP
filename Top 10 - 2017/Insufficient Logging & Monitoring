How to Prevent

As per the risk of the data stored or processed by the application:
* Ensure all login, access control failures, and server-side input validation failures can be logged with sufficient user context to identify suspicious or malicious accounts, and held for sufficient time to allow delayed forensic analysis.
* Ensure that logs are generated in a format that can be easily consumed by a centralized log management solutions.
* Ensure high-value transactions have an audit trail with integrity controls to prevent tampering or deletion, such as append-only database tables or similar.
* Establish effective monitoring and alerting such that suspicious activities are detected and responded to in a timely fashion.
* Establish or adopt an incident response and recovery plan, such as NIST 800-61 rev 2 or later.
There are commercial and open source application protection frameworks such as OWASP AppSensor (old wiki), web application firewalls such as ModSecurity with the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set, and log correlation software with custom dashboards and alerting.
